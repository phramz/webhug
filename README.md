Webhug ðŸ¤—
==========

A generic webhook dispatcher.

## Build & Run

``` 
git clone https://github.com/phramz/webhug.git
make build
./webhug

> INFO : 2020/01/25 18:25:03.520102 webhug.go:16: reading config ...
> INFO : 2020/01/25 18:25:03.521061 webhug.go:20: setting up webhook 'example' at path '/example'
> INFO : 2020/01/25 18:25:03.521134 webhug.go:37: ðŸ¤— webhug listening on :8080 ...
```

With the default config you should now be able to try this:
``` 
curl -H 'x-auth-token: top secret' -X POST -d '{"some": ["random", "json"]}' http://localhost:8080/example

> [example] {"some": ["random", "json"]}HOSTNAME=fbc56923c4e7
> [example] SHLVL=1
> [example] HOME=/root
> [example] WEBHUG_WEBHOOK=example
> [example] WEBHUG_REQUEST_HEADER={"Accept":["*/*"],"Content-Length":["28"],"Content-Type":["application/x-www-form-urlencoded"],"User-Agent":["curl/7.64.1"],"X-Auth-Token":["top secret"]}
> [example] RELEASE_VERSION=d770d49e68
> [example] PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
> [example] CUSTOM_ENV_VAR1=hello
> [example] WEBHUG_REQUEST_REMOTE_ADDR=172.17.0.1:48240
> [example] CUSTOM_ENV_VAR2=world!
> [example] WEBHUG_REQUEST_METHOD=POST
> [example] PWD=/etc/webhug

```

## Docker

There is also a docker image available. If you prefer running webhug inside a container try this:
``` 
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 gregthebunny/webhug
```

Within the image the default config is located at `/etc/webhug/config.yaml`. To provide your own config you
might either mount it into the container
``` 
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -v /path/to/your/config.yaml:/etc/webhug/config.yaml gregthebunny/webhug
```

or build your on image eg:

```Dockerfile
FROM gregthebunny/webhug

COPY /path/to/your/config.yaml /etc/webhug/config.yaml
```

As the image comes with a docker-in-docker setup (`FROM docker:19.03`) it enables you to
run docker commands within your actions. To do so you need to mount your hosts docker socket into the 
container:
``` 
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
    -v /path/to/your/config.yaml:/etc/webhug/config.yaml \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    gregthebunny/webhug 
```
    
## Config

All configuration has to be done in the `config.yaml` file. A working example can be found 
in the project root:

```yaml
---
webhug:
  listen: ":8080"
  webhooks:
    # "example" is the name of the webhook as well as the the endpoint uri eg:
    # curl -H 'x-auth-token: top secret' -X POST -d '{"some": ["random", "json"]}' http://localhost:8080/example
    example:
      # does not yet have any meaning due to only "custom" is supported by now
      format: custom
      security:
        # one of "header" (match header value), "none" (no security at all), "deny" (deny all)
        type: header
        key: x-auth-token
        value: top secret
      action:
        # one of "shell" (execute shell command), "none" (do nothing)
        type: shell
        # if true stdout will be returned in the http response
        response: true
        # the executable to run
        cmd: "/bin/sh"
        # arguments that will be passed along to the executable
        args: ["-c", "cat; env; sleep 10;"]
        # some extra environment variables that will be injected.
        env:
          - "CUSTOM_ENV_VAR1=hello"
          - "CUSTOM_ENV_VAR2=world!"
``` 

### Security

The security section lets you configure the authentication for each webhook.

#### Deny

This will deny every request. Might be useful to temporary disable a certain webhook:
```yaml
webhug:
  webhooks:
    example:
      security:
        type: deny
``` 
#### None

*Please do not run any "open" webhooks in production .. nasty things can happen!*

The following example will leave your webhook open for everyone: 
```yaml
webhug:
  webhooks:
    example:
      security:
        type: none
``` 
#### Header

The most basic way of access control lets you define a shared secret to be present in the request header.
This is not recommended but better then nothing. Always make sure that you make your endpoint SSL only!

```yaml
webhug:
  webhooks:
    example:
      security:
        type: header
        key: x-any-header-you-like
        value: abc123topsecrettoken
``` 

Trigger your webhook like that:
``` 
curl -H 'x-any-header-you-like: abc123topsecrettoken' -X POST http://localhost:8080/example
```

#### Github

This will check for githubs `X-Hub-Signature` header and validates the digest using the shared secret:
```yaml
webhug:
  webhooks:
    example:
      security:
        type: github
        secret: 123456789abcdefghi
```

### Actions

By now there is only one action supported with more to come.

#### Shell

This will execute the given command and passes the request body to stdin (see example). The following
environment variables will be available by default:

- `WEBHUG_WEBHOOK`: Name of the webhook which triggered the action
- `WEBHUG_REQUEST_METHOD`: The request method
- `WEBHUG_REQUEST_REMOTE_ADDR`: The remote address which triggered the action
- `WEBHUG_REQUEST_HEADER`: All request headers json encoded
